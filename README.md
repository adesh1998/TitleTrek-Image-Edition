## 7. Reflections on Design and Development Process

The exciting journey of creating the "TitleTrek" game saw a unique and engaging user experience being crafted by us. This reflection will now delve into the key stages of the process and highlight the lessons learned along the way.

**Project Initiation:**

The project's objective - to create a picture puzzle game challenging users to guess movie titles with pictures and emojis - was defined at the outset. A fun and interactive user experience was the goal, guiding the entire development process. The specific features and rules of the game were meticulously identified in the requirements gathering phase. The chosen technology stack included HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the jQuery library for a seamless and interactive user experience.

**Conceptualization and Planning:**

Two game levels, Novice Trek and Advanced Trek, were detailed in this phase. Novice Trek allowed users to guess movie titles from emojis with four answer options, while Advanced Trek was more challenging, requiring users to guess movie titles from pictures with hints and clues but no multiple-choice answers. Designing the user interface was a crucial aspect, shaping the game's visual appeal and usability. We envisioned the layout, color scheme, and styling using wireframes and design mockups. Our division of responsibilities was based on our strengths, with Rishitha handling CSS and HTML, Aadesh managing JavaScript for interactivity, and Akshitha integrating the jQuery library and designing engaging questions.

**Development:**

Frontend development, the core of our project, brought our design concepts to life. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were combined to create a seamless user experience. The jQuery library was a crucial component, enhancing user interactions and providing smooth functionality.

**Testing and Refinement:**

Rigorous testing was critical, beginning with Novice Trek, ensuring emojis and answer options worked correctly and that the game was user-friendly. Advanced Trek, a more complex level, required extensive development and testing. Hints and clues were incorporated to enhance user engagement. Cross-browser testing guaranteed compatibility with various web browsers, ensuring consistent functionality.

**Deployment:**

Deployment involved setting up a version control repository on GitHub for collaborative development. Game files were hosted on GitHub Pages, allowing easy public access without installation requirements

**User Testing:**

Beta testing with a select group of users and feedback incorporation were pivotal. Eliminating the 5-second time limit per question was a significant change based on user feedback, making the game more user-friendly. The user registration process was streamlined, enhancing overall user experience.

**Release and Future Enhancements:**

The game was successfully released to the public. Future updates and feature enhancements are planned, ensuring an appealing and challenging game.

In conclusion, the creation of the "TitleTrek" game was a fulfilling experience that led to an engaging and interactive user experience. The process emphasized the significance of user feedback and the importance of adapting to user needs. We look forward to continually improving and expanding the game to reach a broader audience while maintaining high standards of quality and entertainment.

## 8. Challenges Faced:

**Tech Stack Selection:** The selection of the appropriate technology stack for the project posed an initial challenge. Factors such as compatibility, ease of development, and user experience had to be considered. This process demanded extensive research and discussion.

**User Interface Design:** Designing an engaging and visually appealing user interface presented a challenging task. Ensuring that the design was user-friendly and coherent with the game's theme required careful attention.

**Cross-Browser Compatibility:** The testing of the game across various web browsers to ensure consistent functionality proved to be a daunting task. Different browsers have unique rendering engines and quirks that needed to be addressed.

**Feedback Incorporation:** The gathering and effective implementation of feedback was a significant challenge. Sorting through diverse user opinions and deciding which changes to make presented a complex process.

**Continuous Improvement:** Sustaining the game's engagement and user enjoyment necessitated ongoing efforts. Continuously adding new features and enhancing existing ones was vital to maintain user interest.

## 9. What Worked:

**Team Collaboration:** The division of responsibilities based on our strengths proved to be an effective strategy and ensured a balanced and harmonious development process.

**Technology Selection:** Ultimately, the choice of the technology stack worked well for the project. The combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery provided the necessary tools for developing the game.

**User Testing:** Conducting beta testing with a select group of users was a productive step. It allowed us to gather valuable feedback and identify issues that might have been missed during development.

**Iterative Design:** Continuously improving the game based on user feedback proved beneficial. The decision to streamline the user registration process based on feedback enhanced user-friendliness.

## 10. What Didn't Work:

**Initial Time Limit:** The addition of a 5-second time limit for each question in the game did not work as expected. User feedback revealed that it affected usability and enjoyment, leading to the decision to proceed to the next question as soon as the user answered the current one.

## 11. Lessons Learned:

**Flexibility is Key:** It's essential to remain flexible in the development process. Recognizing that our initial time limit wasn't working and promptly adapting to user feedback was a valuable lesson.

**User-Centric Approach:** Users' feedback is invaluable. Incorporating user opinions, improving the game based on their preferences, and streamlining processes for quicker user interaction helped enhance the game's overall quality.

**Collaboration Matters:** Effective collaboration and division of responsibilities among team members are crucial. Utilizing each team member's strengths is essential for optimal results.

**Continuous Improvement:** To keep users engaged, ongoing support and feature enhancements are vital. Planning for future updates based on user feedback is a smart strategy.

The design and development of TitleTrek was a dynamic process, where challenges were encountered and addressed as a team. By staying adaptable, focusing on user feedback, and refining our development process, we were able to create a successful and enjoyable game. The experience has equipped us with valuable lessons that we can carry forward into future projects, ensuring continued growth and success in our work.
